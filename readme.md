# Rogue

Rogue is a hobbyist project based around creating a procedurally generated roguelike experience. 

While in early stages, it already features scalable FPS and resolution which do not impact how the game runs. It also features real time collision detection taking into account individual body parts of the character. The map is randomly generated ensuring the player is spawned in an empty location.

## Installation

Copy the file from the repository and proceed to install pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```
