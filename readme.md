# Rogue

Rogue is a hobbyist project based around creating a procedurally generated roguelike gameplay. 

While in early stages, it already features scalable FPS without affecting the rate of the game, as well as real time collision detection taking into account individual body parts of the character. The map is randomly generated ensuring the player is spawned in an empty location.



## Installation
